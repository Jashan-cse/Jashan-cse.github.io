MY EXCEL CERTIFICATE 

MY EXCEL COURSE EXPERIENCE 

I recently completed an MS Excel course through www.mygreatLearning.com , and it has been a highly enriching experience. The course covered essential features of Excel, from basic functionalities to more advanced data analysis techniques. It was structured in a way that was easy to follow, with hands-on exercises that helped me grasp each concept effectively. The instructors were knowledgeable and provided practical insights that were directly applicable to real-world scenarios.

EXAMPLE OF EXCEL FUNCTIONS.

1:SUM Function:

•The SUM function is used to add up a range of numbers.
•Example: If you have numbers in cells A1 to A5 (say, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50), you can use =SUM(A1:A5) to get the total, which would be 150.
2:MIN Function:

•The MIN function returns the smallest number in a range.
•Example: Using the same numbers as above, =MIN(A1:A5) would give you 10, which is the smallest number in the range.

3:MAX Function:
•The MAX function returns the largest number in a range.
•Example: With the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 in cells A1 to A5, =MAX(A1:A5) would return 50, the largest number.

4:AVERAGE Function:

•The AVERAGE function calculates the average (mean) of a range of numbers.
•Example: Continuing with the numbers above, =AVERAGE(A1:A5) would give you the average, which is 30 (since (10+20+30+40+50)/5 = 30).

5:COUNT Function:

•The COUNT function counts the number of cells that contain numbers within a specified range.
•Example: If you have numbers and blank cells in cells A1 to A5, =COUNT(A1:A5) would count how many cells contain numbers.
•By learning and applying these functions, I gained practical skills
